# Limited Observables Discrete Choice Model Estimation
The repository contains the relevant code and output results for my a simple study in estimating a discrete choice price model.

Please contact me at jeonghyun0925@gmail.com for any inquiries or questions on the materials.

# Directory
- The code folder contains the code for creating the simulated data, running the simulations and producing the relevant output files.
- The output folder contains the created data (due to size constraints, we keep the folder empty here), estimated coefficients data, and images.
- The LateX folder contain the relveant $\LaTeX$ files.
